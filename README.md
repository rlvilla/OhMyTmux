# OhMyTmux
## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
 
Bash script to install Tmux, ZSH and other of my favorite tools. Autoconfigures tmux to work with ZSH, adds oh-my-zsh and plugins. Currently tested working in Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Ubuntu Mate, Parrot and Kali. 

This is recommended for fresh/new machines.

It may break your current installation.

Run with 
```
./ohmytmux.sh
```
